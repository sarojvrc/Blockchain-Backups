## What is Blockchain Mining? And how does it happen?

**Well, **

I hope all are doing good. Today we will see about blockchain mining and its process. 

Cool!

So, **what exactly is Blockchain mining?**

Any idea? 

In simple words, Mining is the process of recording new transactions on the blockchain ledger. Or we can say, it is the process by which we can add a new block inside a blockchain network. 

*Saroj, what is this process, what is mining, it's confusing... huh! explain more.*

wait guys, we will see in-depth! 

*:)*
### Process of Mining

As you know, a blockchain is a decentralized network(*or group of nodes*), and there is no central or head node. So when a new node wants to join that network, it's not possible to join directly. It must have some process to add to that network, it's called the Mining process. 

*Ohh is it? Saroj, we got some idea about Mining Process, but who actually add this node into the network? *

Yaa, Good question. 

*So, who will do the mining?* 

Miners need to do the Mining! A miner is nothing but a computer or group of computers. Humans can also be a miner, but the solution is more complex for us to solve. A Miner needs to do some solution to add a block. Mining rewards are given to the miner who first finds the solution to a complicated hashing problem(*solution*). 

Still, getting confused? Let's try to understand using a diagram.

Let's say I am a miner. I need to solve a mathematical solution to add a block to the network. If I found the solution, then the block will be added to the blockchain network. But, what happens if I am not able to find the solution? In that case, my transaction will be added to the transaction pool. It is nothing but, a group of unconfirmed transactions, that are waiting to be added. 

**wait wait... it's not finished yet!**

Let's imagine, there is a blockchain network containing 30 blocks. And there is a hacker, he/she wants to hack this network by adding a new block or group of blocks. Then it's a problem, right? 

*yes Saroj, it's a big issue. How can we solve this issue? *

**Here, the Longest Chain Rule comes into the picture. :)**

### Longest Chain Rule

The longest chain rule is a rule that a miner must follow if he/she wants to do the mining. 

![Chain Rule 2.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1650131329830/nMWmodMPL.png)

Let's say, there are two groups of blocks(nodes), one is about 6 blocks, and the second one(*attackers*) is about 3 blocks. In that case, the blockchain network will accept only the longest chain blocks(*group one*) and the second group will be rejected. A blockchain with more blocks will consume more energy to build than a chain with fewer blocks. And, always node follows the longest chain rule. 

**Also, mining is two types**
- **Solo Mining**
- **Polo Mining**

In solo mining, only 1 computer is involved in the mining process, whereas in the case of polo mining, a group of computers is involved in the mining process. 

**Got some idea about mining and miners? **

*yes man, thanks for the great info about mining and miners. *

**Great!**
